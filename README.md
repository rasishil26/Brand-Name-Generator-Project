# 🧠 Brand Name Generator Project

Hi! 👋 This is one of the very first Python projects I built while learning to code. It's a fun and simple **brand name generator** that takes two inputs from the user and combines them into a creative brand name.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I wanted to practice the basics of Python — especially how to take user input, work with strings, and print results. I thought generating a brand name based on your city and pet name would be a fun way to do that!

## 🚀 What It Does

Here's how the project works:

1. It asks you for the name of the city you grew up in.
2. Then it asks for your pet’s name.
3. Finally, it combines both to generate a brand name!

### Example:
Welcome to the Brand Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in? → Kolkata
What's your pet's name? → Luna
Your brand name could be: Kolkata Luna

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- Python 3.x
- Just the basics — `input()`, `print()`, and a little bit of string formatting.
